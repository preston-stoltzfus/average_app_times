Data Analysist:	Preston Stoltzfus

Problem: Technician suporvisor feels that certain "technician appointments" are taking longer then the scheduled amount of time.
	
Goal: Identify how long the "diabetic consult" times take for technician appontments. Management is also curious about appointment lengths in general and how they can vary from each location (they have 3).

Privacy: Clients names have been removed

Data: The veterinary hospital uses a program called "cornerstone" (which is made by a company called "Idexx") which keeps all the data that will be used for this project. Report used cornerstone is called "census report" and shows all patients in the selected time frame along with times in/out of the hospital, what they were here for, and several other fields. When a patient walks into the building they get "checked-in" and when they pay their bill after the appointment they get "checked-out" which shows when they leave the hospital.  

Stakeholders: Technician manager and office manager

Deliverable: 	File (csv or excel) showing average appointment length for the "main" types of appointments the hospital sees.
